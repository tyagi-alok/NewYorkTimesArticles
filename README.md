# NewYorkTimesArticles

-> This is an assessment application where I have used New York times most popular articles API. 

-> This app is implementing MVVM architecture written in Swift. It uses a simple restful service to fetch the data.

-> Entire Project is distributed in different folders each representing the modules, service , repository layer, Application layers etc.

-> Entire code is written in terms of Protocol oriented programming which helps in loosely couple code, testable and helps in easy inject Dependencies. This makes the maintainability, scalability also easier.
    Each layer is separated so that separation of responsibility will be
    mantained. 

-> Aims to keep everything simple, but modular and reusable.

Build, Test.

-> App can be run manually through Xcode inbuilt system by pressing command +R.

-> All App Test cases(Unit Test) can be run by pressing command +R or by going to test navigator and run all together or can select class and run all cases or can run individual.
